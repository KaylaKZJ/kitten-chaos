# Kitten Chaos

This project is a playful interactive app featuring kittens and objects in a virtual room. Below are suggestions for improving the codebase and user experience:

## Improvement Suggestions

### 1. Performance

- Use functional updates for state setters (e.g., `setKittens`, `setObjects`) to avoid stale closures.
- Memoize callbacks with dependencies to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

### 2. Accessibility

- Add `aria-live` to the HUD for screen readers to announce changes in chaos/order.
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible.

### 3. Code Organization

- Extract large sections (like kitten/object renderers) into smaller components for readability.
- Move inline styles and keyframes to CSS modules or a global stylesheet if possible.

### 4. Type Safety

- Add explicit types to all function parameters and state where possible.

### 5. Cleanup

- Ensure all event listeners and timers are properly cleaned up in `useEffect` return functions.

### 6. User Experience

- Add a confirmation dialog to the reset button to prevent accidental resets.
- Optionally, add animations for adding/removing kittens/objects.

### 7. Reduce Magic Numbers

- Move repeated numbers (like `24px`, `44px`, etc.) to constants for easier maintenance.

### 8. SoundManager Instantiation

- Consider instantiating `SoundManager` outside the component or in a context to avoid re-creation on every render.

### 9. Error Handling

- Add error boundaries or try/catch blocks where asynchronous or potentially error-prone code is used.

### 10. Testing

- Add unit and integration tests for core logic and UI interactions.

These improvements will enhance maintainability, accessibility, and user experience.
